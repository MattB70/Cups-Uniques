# Cup's Uniques

***

### Bugs, Crashes, Incompatibles, etc.,
Please report all of the above in the issues page on this repo. I do not care if you submit an issue that others may consider spam. It's very easy to keep track of github issues. If you think you have something worth reporting, you likely do, and I ask you to do so.
